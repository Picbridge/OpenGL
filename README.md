# OpenGL projects

A hybrid rendering pipeline that employs a **Deferred Rendering** , **bounding volume hierarchy**, and **Adaptive Octree and BSP-tree representation**.

## Features

### Controls

  - Use W,A,S,D,Q,E to move the camera.

### Lightsource
  
  - Generate/Deletes random colored light

### Bounding Volumes

  - AABB, OBB Bounding Sphere, Bounding Sphere(centroid), Larsson's method, Ritterâ€™s method, Bounding Sphere (PCA method)

  - Top-down constructionAABB,Bounding Spheres
  
  - Bottom-up construction Larsson's method

### Spatial Partitioning
  
  - Octree: Adaptive octree in top-down fashion. Shows all levels of the octree in different colors
  
  - BST Tree: Shows all leaf nodes of the BSP tree in a different color
